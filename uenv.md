# Providing software via CPE

<div>
The Cray Programming Environment is complex by necessity:
- Modules provide a combinatorial set of libraries and tools that serve as many use cases as possible
- Ingration is provided by HPE: once an issue is identified HPE have to fix the issue in a future release
  - long latency between issue reporting and the fix
- Each new release requires extensive testing to check that the issues have been fixed
  - And to identify the inevatible new issues
- CSCS will no longer provide software built using CPE for users

# A UENV is a self-contained software stack

A uenv is two components:

1. A squashfs file
   - "a read-only file system that lets you compress whole file systems or single directories, to write them to ordinary files, and then mount them using a loopback device"
   - A single file that contains everything in a working environment
2. Meta data
   - information about the uenv build (when, where, who)
   - the recipe that was used to build
   - information about the contents of the uenv
   - **environment configurations**

---


# A UENV has to available on the local file system to be used

Store in repository, which is a directory with:
- A database: **index.db**
- A hashed path for each uenv that contains
  - the squashfs image **store.squashfs**
  - meta data: **env.json**

---

# How it works

1. Unshare linux mount namespace
2. Mount the squashfs image
3. Return to unprivileged user

# Material science UENVs

- Gromacs
- QuantumESPRESSO
- SIRIUS

# Code compilation using modules

```bash
uenv start quantumespresso/v7.3.1
uenv modules use
module load cmake \
    fftw \
    nvhpc \
    nvpl-lapack \
    nvpl-blas \
    cray-mpich \
    netlib-scalapack \
    libxc

mkdir build && cd build

# Code compilation using spack

```bash
uenv start quantumespresso
. $SCRATCH/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```


Use an independent spack environment [https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#independent-environments](link)
```yaml
spack:
  specs:
  - quantumespresso%nvhpc +cuda build_type=Release
  develop:
    quantumespresso:
      path: /path/to/q-e/src
      spec: quantumespresso@develop
  packages:
    all:
      variants: cuda_arch=90
  view:
      default
```
